Pungi
An anaconda based installation spin tool

This project is aimed at making a public / free tool to spin installation
trees/isos of Fedora.  It will be written in python (for many obvious
reasons).  Code style I hope will be of a simple "master" process that can
call any number of subprocesses depending on a configuration set.

See http://hosted.fedoraproject.org/projects/pungi for more information.
