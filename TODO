Random thoughts on what needs to be done before Pungi 4.0 is completed.


Define building blocks and their metadata
=========================================

* rpms in yum repos
* comps
* kickstart trees
* isos
* kickstart trees
* bootable images
* readme files
* license(s)


Compose structure
=================
* topdir
  * work, logs, etc.
  * compose
    * $variant
      * $arch
        * $content_type (rpms, isos, kickstart trees, etc.)
          * actual content


Split Pungi into smaller well-defined tools
===========================================

* process initial packages
  * comps
  * json mapping
  * ???

* grab initial package set
  * yum repos
  * koji instance (basically what mash does today)

* resolve deps (gather)
  * self-hosting
  * fulltree
  * multilib
  * langpacks

* create repos

* create install images
  * lorax
  * buildinstall

* create isos
  * isos
    * bootable
    * hybrid
    * implant md5sum
  * jigdo
  * checksums

* run tests
  * just quick sanity tests

* notification
  * email
  * messagebus


Unsorted
========
* run any tasks in koji or local host
* support for non-rpm content? (java artifacts, etc.)
* docs!
* unit tests!
* use productmd for metadata: https://github.com/release-engineering/productmd/
* use next-gen tools: createrepo_c, mergerepo_c, dnf, hawkey, libcomps
