This directory contains scripts to compare YUM and DNF based gathering code in
Pungi.

There are two scripts to help re-run the depsolving on existing code. As input
they need .conf and .log file from an existing compose. They collect correct
command line options from them and run the respective tool.

Run:

    $ run-dnf.sh Server.x86_64.conf
    $ run-yum.sh Server.x86_64.conf

The results are stored in a file with .log.dnf or .log.yum extensions. When
--interactive is used as second argument of the scripts, the output is printed
to terminal (useful for running in debugger).

To compare the RPM package lists, run:

    $ ./pungi-compare-depsolving Server.x86_64.log.yum Server.x86_64.log.dnf
