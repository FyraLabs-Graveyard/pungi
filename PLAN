Fedora Install Spin Tool (Name could change at any moment)

This project is aimed at making a public / free tool to spin installation
trees/isos of Fedora.  It will be written in python (for many obvious
reasons).  Code style I hope will be of a simple "master" process that can
call any number of subprocesses depending on a configuration set.

Thoughtspace:
We'll need to do five basic tasks:
  1) Gather packages from repos into a directory tree
  2) Run anaconda tools (buildinstall) on said directory tree
  3) Split tree into CD iso size chunks
  4) Create isos of the chunks
  5) Sanity check the tree

Gathering Packages
  Using yumdownloader in combination with a comps file makes sense here.  We
  can define what we want at the top level and let yum depsolve the rest.
  The tricky bits here are figuring out multilib stuff and the uglyness that
  is noarch packages with ExcludeArch/ExclusiveArch crack.

Running Anaconda Tools
  These should be ran on the release it is releasing.  This means using mock
  in some way, either make mock a req of the tool and the tool calls mock
  or allowing the tool to run in userspace but suggest the tool get ran in
  a mock call.  Some cooperation will need to happen with the anaconda folks
  to make sure we're moving in the same direction they are wrt the tools we
  would use.

Split Tree Into CD Size Chunks
  This will be a fun task.  Really, I mean it.  Anaconda folks have made some
  noise about making buildinstall take a flag to make CDs and do all the
  splitting itself.  That would be handy, but it may not happen by the time
  we need to do this.  Perhaps work on this part last, focus on the
  installable tree stuff.

Create Isos of the Chunks
  This is a pretty straightforward call to mkisofs.  There are some fun things
  to consider when making isos for ppc(64) and possibly other arches that may
  come to play.  Code here will need to be somewhat modular to allow for
  different mkisofs calls per arch.

Sanity Check the Tree
  This could/should be an ever growing set of post-tree build sanity checks.
  Hopefully it'll cut down on brown paperbag trees sneaking out.
