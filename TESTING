This dir holds files useful for testing functionality.

comps.xml - A fairly minimal comps that includes enough to create an
            installable tree and a bootable system.

yum.conf.[i386,x86_64] - Yum configs that point to arch specific location.
                         (needed as $basearch is resolved from the host OS)
