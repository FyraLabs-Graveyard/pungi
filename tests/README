Running pungi4 tests

Pungi4 is an utility to perform composes of rpms, as such we will need some
rpms to perform composes on.

In this directory you will find a small utility called 'createtestdata.py' that
takes two arguments, first is the package manifest JSON file that will contain
the list of packages that are architecture specific, the list of architectures
to build them for, and finally the packages that are noarch. (Don't worry about
your dev machine being the wrong arch as needed to be produced, we're using an
utility library called rpmfluff[0] that's faking a lot of this for us)

Before we run any tests we will need to create a repo to work with using the
'createtestdata.py' script. NOTE: This script requires both the 'python-click
and 'python-rpmfluff' packages.

    $ ./createtestdata.py --pkgfile pkgs.json --outdir .

You will now find a directory called ./repo in the current directory, this is
setup exactly as the pungi tests need it and you are now ready to run tests.

Next you will find a hand full of scripts named test_* and these are to run the
actual tests. There is also a small wrapper called 'run_all_tests.sh' that will
run all scripts prefixed with test_* in the current directory.

    $ ./run_all_tests.sh

Or alternatively, select the tests you want to run and run them one by one:

    $ ./test_arch.py
    ......
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Ran 6 tests in 0.001s

    OK

    $ ./test_pathmatch.py
    ...
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Ran 3 tests in 0.001s

    OK
